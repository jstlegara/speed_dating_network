# Speed Dating & Network Science Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of speed dating data through the lens of network science. The project aims to uncover patterns and dynamics in speed dating, focusing on how men and women approach and perceive one another.

## Key Highlights

<ul>
  <li>Utilized bipartite graph projections to examine dating preferences.</li>
  <li>Analyzed undirected and directed graph metrics to understand dating dynamics.</li>
  <li>Explored gender-based differences in selectivity and desirability.</li>
  <li>Computed clustering coefficients to study similarity in dating preferences among participants.</li>
</ul>

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis captures speed dating results from various waves, with attributes such as participant ID, partner ID, and whether there was a match or not.

## Methodology

<ul>
  <li>The dataset was processed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies.</li>
  <li>Graphs were constructed to study the dynamics of the speed dating process.</li>
  <li>Degree distributions, clustering coefficients, and other relevant metrics were computed to derive insights.</li>
</ul>

## Findings

<ul>
  <li>Females tend to be more selective in their preferences.</li>
  <li>Men tend to express 'like' more broadly.</li>
  <li>Clustering coefficient patterns suggest that the qualities attractive to one woman are likely to be attractive to another.</li>
</ul>
